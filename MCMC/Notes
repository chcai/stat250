Can use BUGS, JAGS, STAN (NIMBLE) to do this.
We are implementing this ourselves for pedagogical purposes.


Gamma distribution
  different ways to parameterize it.
   alpha is shape
   beta is scale

Inverse Gamma random variable is a 1 / X where X is a Gamma random variable.


Use
  R CMD COMPILE mcmc.c
since we will be using routines from R's Rmath library for random number generation.
